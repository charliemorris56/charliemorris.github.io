									<h3 class="major">IT Protocol 2018 - 2019</h3>
									<p>For the first year at IT Protocol I was an apprentice, and thus spent three weeks out of the year on a training course, I did my apprenticeship through 3AAA, then change to Mercia Partnership.</p>
									<p>At the end of my apprenticeship, I told my boss about my aspirations to go to university and study games programming, my boss was happy to keep me on until then.</p>
									<p>I built the website at IT Protocol, <a href="https://www.itprotocol.com/">itprotocol.com</a> the website was built using SquareSpace, but there is a lot of custom CSS in order to make the website more unique. The navigation bar moving down the page with you is one of these additions.</p>
									<p>My main roles at ITP were working on the support desk and helping with projects. One such project that I am proud of is when my boss tasked me with creating a new CRM system, at first I had to do the research, I found 3 different CRM systems, two of which were self hosted and one was online, we decided not to go with the online version for security reasons. Out of the other two systems one was an updated version of what we were using, so apart from being a new lick of paint there was little incentive to upgrade. The other system was Microsoft CRM, I had to set up the SQL server and the Windows server to host the CRM system, these were both virtual systems on VMWare. Once Microsoft CRM was setup I ported over all the information that we had on our old system, after playing around with it and talking through it with my boss we decided to stick with our old CRM system due to its reliability and Microsoft CRM lacking features we were accustomed to. Even though the task I was set did not end in a complete success I value the learning experience.</p>
									<p>One project that did end in a success was creating a two factor authentication system for our remote desktop server, for this I used the product Duo by Cisco, I had to research the product and implement it to work with specified uses on Active Directory. I also had to add in custom group policy rules. As ITP are an IT services provider, I was able to get us some NFR keys for internal testing. The reason for my setting up this system was that one of our clients was getting their ISO27001 and the two factor authentication system would have improved their security.</p>
									<p>I could have continued working at ITP or have moved to a different company but I decided that I wanted to follow my passion whist I am still young and have the time. If I continued within that industry I would have liked to be an IT administration.</p>
									<br>

									<h3 class="major">University of South Wales, Computing Mathematics 2014 - 2017</h3>
									<p>Before working at IT Protocol, I was at university studying Computing Mathematics, which was a joint course between computer science and mathematics, it was about 2/3 mathematics and ran by the mathematics department.</p>
								 	<p>Mathematics was my best subject at school and thus I choose to do it at A levels, which lead to me choosing to do it at university. I started to realise that I did not like the job prospects at the end of the course and I was also falling behind on some modules, this led me to drop out and pursue working with computers, at first I wanted to go into a programming apprenticeship but due to me having done some at university, the government finance was not available.</p>
								 	<p>Whilst at university I did a course creating a simple game on the Raspberry PI, it was the most fun and engaging course I did, this is what lead me to go back to university and try my hand at games programming.</p>
