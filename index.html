										<h2 class="major">What I have been working towards in year 2</h2>
									 	<p><strong>Game Creation | JavaScript.</strong>
										 I have been working on my own game for fun, the game is in the style of an arena fighter with tanks. Use WASD plus spacebar for the green tank and the arrow keys plus right shift for the orange tank.
										 Each time you hit the other tank your firepower increases thus the enemy is knocked back more. Your firepower is reset when they respawn.<br>
										 <a href="games\tank_battles\index.html" target="_blank"><img src="assets\images\tankRightOrange.png" alt="windows forms" style="max-width:100%"> Play me in browser!</a></p>
										<p><strong>Android Application Development | Java XML.</strong>
										 In my free time I have been working on an Android app, this was my first attempt at using Java and XML.
										 I am very happy with the results and have learned a lot.<br>
										 <iframe width="720" height="480" style="max-width:100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/17qQ_pt76iA"></iframe></p>
										<p><strong>Concurrent Network Applications | C#.</strong>
										 Working with networking, multi-threading elements and socket programming eagerly towards a game with networking capabilities.
										 Multi-threading has been a good learning experience, one which changes your concept of programming from one where everything runs from top to bottom, to the concept of process happening at the same time.<br>
										 <img src="assets\images\cna.png" alt="windows forms" style="max-width:100%"></p>
										<p><strong>Further Games and Graphics | C++ DirectX11.</strong>
										 Enthusiastically learning the consepts of DirectX11.
										 In the 3D scene there are textures and models loaded in from files, some of the models are transparent. Using shaders for lightling.<br>
										 Learning shaders is a good challange, after I installed a syntex editor my life got a who lot easier.<br>
										 <img src="assets\images\fgg.png" alt="directx11" style="max-width:100%"></p>
										<p><strong>Website Development | HTML CSS.</strong>
										 As well as working on my personal website here, I have also been free lancing on IT Protocol's new website. Currently a work in progress.

									<h2 class="major">Life as an IT Technician</h2>
									<p><strong>IT Technician IT Protocol.</strong>
									 IT Protocol is an IT services provider. After I finished at South Wales, I decided that I wanted to work in the IT field.
									 I thought that the best way to get into the industry was to become an apprentice.
								 	 I did my apprenticeship through 3AAA then switched to Mercia Partnership.<br>
								 	 At the end of my apprenticeship I told my boss Richard about my aspirations to study computer games programming, Richard was happy to keep me on untill then.
								 	 I have even free lanced for him a few times; to cover when he is on holiday and building there website.</p>
									<p><strong>Communication & Time Management.</strong>
									 My main roles at ITP were working on the support desk. I had to answer phone calls and email. Richard worked from home a lot; it was up to me to manage my time.
									 Some support cases were easier then others, sometimes a user would have forgotten to turn their second screen on, and other times you were on the phone for hours or had to go to the manufacturer for answers.
								 	 I was responsible for all my cases and had to document everything I did in our CRM system.</p>
									<p><strong>Teamwork & Documentation.</strong>
									 Before I started working at ITP one of our clients got hacks, which resulted in their website going down for a few days, as they are an online retailer this was unacceptable.
									 We were tasked with creating a disaster recovery system which would mean if the same event the site would not be down for more then a few hours.
									 This required a lot of teamwork and documentation; one of my first jobs was to document the whole virtual machine building process from first turning the physical server on to setting the network options in VMWare, the document was about 50 pages to start with but we managed to narrow it down to about 30.</p>
									<p><strong>Independent Research.</strong>
									 One such project that I am proud of is when my boss tasked me with creating a new CRM system, at first I had to do the research, I found 3 different CRM systems, two of which were self hosted and one was online, we decided not to go with the online version for security reasons.
									 Out of the other two systems one was an updated version of what we were using, so apart from being a new lick of paint there was little incentive to upgrade.
									 The other system was Microsoft CRM, I had to set up the SQL server and the Windows server to host the CRM system, these were both virtual systems on VMWare.
									 Once Microsoft CRM was setup I ported over all the information that we had on our old system, after playing around with it and talking through it with my boss we decided to stick with our old CRM system due to its reliability and Microsoft CRM lacking features we were accustomed to.
									 Even though the task I was set did not end in a complete success I value the learning experience.</p>
 									<p><strong>Technical Development.</strong>
									 Another project that did end in a success was creating a two factor authentication system for our remote desktop server, for this I used the product Duo by Cisco, I had to research the product and implement it to work with specified uses on Active Directory.
									 I also had to add in custom group policy rules. As ITP are an IT services provider, I was able to get us some NFR keys for internal testing. The reason for my setting up this system was that one of our clients was getting   their ISO27001 and the two factor authentication system would have improved their security.</p>
									<p><strong>Presenting.</strong>
									 Whist working at IT Protocol one of our clients wanted a website to supplement their physical store, I build them a relatively inexpensive SquareSpace website.
									 After I had finished getting the website up and running and porting some of the old website over for the sake of demo, I was in charge of creating a presentation for the store owners.
								 	 I was able to successfully present the new website to the client as well as demo how to update it.</p>
									<p>I could have continued working at ITP or have moved to a different company but I decided that I wanted to follow my passion whist I am still young and have the time. If I continued within that industry I would have liked to be an IT administration.</p>

										<h2 class="major">University of South Wales | Computing Mathematics</h2>
										<p>Computing Mathematics was a joint course between computer science and mathematics, it was about 2/3 mathematics and ran by the mathematics department.</p>
										<p><strong>Integrated and Interactive Systems | Python.</strong>
										 My favourite memory from South Wales was when do had to create a game on the Raspberry PI, we had an attachment on the PI called Sense HAT which is an 8x8 RGB display as well as a bunch of different sensors including temperature, acceleration, etc..
										 The game was very simple, an arrow would appear on the HAT’s display and then you had to rotate the PI in order to make the arrow point up, the time limit would get smaller and smaller until you ran out of time and then your score would be displayed.
										 This project was the reason in which I decided to come back to university and study gaming.</p>
										<p><strong>Graphics Development | C++ OpenGL.</strong>
										 We were tasked with creating a 2D & 3D scene. With the 2D scene we had to have different objects move around the screen. With the 3D scene we were given a model of a plane and we had to animate it in the scene.</p>
										<p><strong>Website Development | HTML CSS</strong>
										 This is when I first started to learn web development.</p>
